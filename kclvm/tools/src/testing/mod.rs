//! [kclvm_tools::testing] module mainly contains some functions of language testing tool.
//!
//! The basic principle of the testing tool is to search for test files in the KCL package
//! that have the suffix "_test.k" and do not start with "_". These test files will be regard
//! as test suites. Within these files, any lambda literals starting with "test_" will be
//! considered as test cases, but these lambda functions should not have any parameters.
//! To perform the testing, the tool compiles the test suite file and its dependencies into an
//! [kclvm_runner::Artifact], which is regard as a new compilation entry point. Then,
//! it executes each test case separately and collects information about the test cases,
//! such as the execution time and whether the test passes or fails.
