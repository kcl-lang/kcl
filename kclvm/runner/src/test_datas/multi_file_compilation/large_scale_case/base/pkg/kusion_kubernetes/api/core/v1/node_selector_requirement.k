    ----------
    key : str, default is Undefined, required
         The label key that the selector applies to.
    operator : str, default is Undefined, required
         Represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist. Gt, and Lt.
    values : [str], default is Undefined, optional
         An array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. If the operator is Gt or Lt, the values array must have a single element, which will be interpreted as an integer. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.
