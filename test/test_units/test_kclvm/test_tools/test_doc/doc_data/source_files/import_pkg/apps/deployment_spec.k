schema DeploymentSpec:
    """ DeploymentSpec is the specification of the desired behavior of the Deployment.

    Attributes
    ----------
    minReadySeconds : int, default is Undefined, optional
         Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available. Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)
    paused : bool, default is Undefined, optional
         Indicates that the deployment is paused.
    progressDeadlineSeconds : int, default is Undefined, optional
         The maximum time in seconds for a deployment to make progress before it is considered to be failed. The deployment controller will continue to process failed deployments and a condition with a ProgressDeadlineExceeded reason will be surfaced in the deployment status. Note that progress will not be estimated during the time a deployment is paused. Defaults to 600s.
    replicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
         Number of desired pods. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 1.
    revisionHistoryLimit : int, default is Undefined, optional
         The number of old ReplicaSets to retain to allow rollback. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 10.
    selector : apis.LabelSelector, default is Undefined, required
         Label selector for pods. Existing ReplicaSets whose pods are selected by this will be the ones affected by this deployment. It must match the pod template's labels.
    strategy : DeploymentStrategy, default is Undefined, optional
         The deployment strategy to use to replace existing pods with new ones.
    template : core.PodTemplateSpec, default is Undefined, required
         Template describes the pods that will be created.
